{{ site.title }} organizes multiple teams for is the a [FIRST][first]&reg; [Tech
Challenge][tc] for [Lake Middle School][lms] in [City of Woodbury][woodbury],
originally formed in the Spring of 2017.

## Questions for Students

### What grade do I have to be to participate?

We are accepting students from grade 6 through grade 8. FIRST Tech Challenge is
officially open to 7th through 12th grade students. Each of the Woodbury area
High Schools has a FIRST Robotics Challenge team, which students would likely
enter in 9th grade. We have currently accepted as many sixth graders as we can
without starting a new team and asking for three new parent mentors to lead that
team.

### Do I need a computer?

No, but it would be helpful. The robots are programmed with software that can be
downloaded and installed on any Macintosh, Windows, or Linux computer. Source
code for your robot can be shared here on the GitHub site for your teams, making
it possible to work on the program for your robot remotely.

### I didn't sign up on time (or I just arrived in the district this Fall), can I still join?

Leopard Robotics registration for the 2018-2019 FTC season is
effectively closed. Registration for the 2019-2020 season will begin
in March of 2019. One could sign up for the *Waitlist*, and if a spot
becomes available on one of the five teams.

Alternatively, if enough students are interested, and if two volunteer
adults step up to become *Lead Mentors*, another team could be
formed. Keep in mind that tounament registrations for our region open
during the last week of September and close in the middle of October.

## Questions for Parents

### How much is the 2018-2019 season fee going to be?

We are asking for a $150 participation fee for each family.

### How often do the children meet?

Teams will meet approximately twice per week once the school season begins, one
weekday evening, and Saturday afternoons. During the summer, we hope to have a
handful of events or gatherings to introduce the kids to the robot kits, get
started with programming, or maybe do a fundraising event (such as a carwash,
etc.).

### How much time is involved?

We expect the weeknight project nights to last a couple of hours, with
Saturday's lasting up to three to four hours. Children are not expected to make
it to every meeting, but are encouraged to spend as much time as they can
working with their teammates.

### My child attends a different school in District 833. Can he/she still participate?

If there is no similar offering at your student's school, they can
participate here. Currently, there is no similar program at New Life
Academy, so those students are eligible to participate.

## Questions for Mentors #

### What do we need to do for background checks? ##

There are two background checks we must complete. One is for the District 833
school system. You can initiate this process by filling out this
[PDF](http://www.sowashco.org/files/department/communications/files/Volunteers/2016VolunteerApplicationForm.pdf)
and turning it into the main office. The office will contact you with
instructions on how to complete an on-line submission form with Trusted
Employees, and it costs $10.25 to fill out.

The second background check is with FIRST, who uses Verified Volunteers to
conduct the check. Although FIRST does not require mentors to pay the $8.00 for
the background check, it is encouraged. Like the Trusted Employees system,
Verified Volunteers is an on-line web form that takes only a few minutes to
complete.

### How often do the mentors meet?

Although we do not have a regular schedule, we expect to meet as a general
assembly to address the business of running the club at least three or four
times per year. Certainly, we will likely go to the same competitions, and teams
will share workspace in the Lake Middle School shop classroom.

## Questions for Everyone

### What is Basecamp, and how to I use it?

[Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com) is a project management platform that
includes an instant message service, message board, calendar, document sharing,
and todo list management. It is the primary source of communication and
management for the club.

There are different "teams" in Basecamp, one called "Leopard Robotics
HQ", one called "Club Mentors & Coaches", and one for each Team we
have. We can also create separate "Projects" as needed.

Basecamp includes both a website as well as mobile clients for all
smart phones.  You can receive emails for all updates, or you can
quiet things down. Basecamp help site provides most details.

## How are the finances going to work? How will we collect fees?

The Leopard Robotics Club operates as a Student Activity Account
through Lake Middle School. Gifts and donations are tax deductible. We
try to budget approximately $3,000 per team per year, $4,000 for
rookie teams. Additionally, we target another 25% for common purchase
items such as the game field or club-wide events.

Participation fees are collected at Lake Middle School along with the
Behavior Contract distributed to participants after they sign up.

## Roughly, when are the competitions going to be?

Qualifying competitions begin in October and extend through early
February.  Typically, FTC teams participate in one or two qualifying
competitions before moving on to State/Regional championships from
December through March.  Super-Regional and World Championships take
place in February to March, and April respectively. The schedule is

# Questions for Sponsors

## Can we accept gifts from sponsors? Will it be tax deductible?

Gifts can be issued to Lake Middle School for the purpose of the
Robotics Club.  Gifts are subject to school Board approval. All gifts
are tax deductible. If you are interested in providing a gift, please
contact info@leopardrobotics.club.
