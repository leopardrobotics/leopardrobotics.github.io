{{ site.title }} is home for five [FIRST][first]&reg; [Tech
Challenge][tc] teams for [Lake Middle School][lms] in [City of
Woodbury][woodbury], where students are challenged to design, build,
program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in
an alliance format. Participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever
have!”

The positive impact on FIRST Tech Challenge participants is gratifying
and well documented. Over 86% have more interest in doing well in
school and 87% are more interested in attending college.

## How Much does it cost? ##

Costs vary from year to year depending on what tools and supplies can be reused.
Teams will need a budget of about $3000 per year.

Student fees cover part of that expense, and sponsors cover the rest.

Student fees to participate this year are *$150 per family*. It covers tshirt,
tools, equipment, and supplies. It does not cover travel and food expenses for
tournaments.

We are always looking for sponsors. If your company or your employer is
interested in sponsoring robotics, come talk to us!

## What does every FIRST Tech Challenge team need? ##

  - 2 or more adult Mentors who are willing and motivated to coach the team through the build and competition season, and beyond!
  - Other adults can volunteer to help with administration, fundraising, community outreach, technical advising, and other tasks.
  - A suitable meeting place and space to design and build a robot about the size of a microwave oven.
  - A standard kit of robot parts and a common set of game and robot rules issued by FIRST Tech Challenge.
  - A budget and a fundraising plan.
  - The desire to learn, explore, strategize, build camaraderie, share ideas and talents, make new friends, be accepted, and HAVE FUN!

## When does FIRST Tech Challenge happen? ##

The FIRST® Tech Challenge season starts in May, when teams generally form and
registration opens. Season kick-off is in early September when the season's game
is announced. The design and build season runs from September to January.
Tournament season varies by region and can begin as early as October and
continues through April. State and Regional Tournaments advance teams to
Super-Regional Championship Tournaments, and winners earn spots at FIRST
Championship at the end of April. There are also many off-season events where
teams participate, strategize, hone their skills, learn new technology, meet
other teams, and have fun!

## What is the time commitment? ##

Generally, plan on 2 meetings per week - one weekday evening and one weekend
meeting time. Meetings run 2-3 hours. There may be more meetings as tournament
time approaches. It is best if students are at all meetings. When they miss
meetings, they have to catch up on what has happened when they were gone, and it
slows down the work.

## Any special skills required? ##

All skill levels are welcomed and needed, technical and non-technical. Teams
need all kinds of skills to succeed, so what are you good at? Chances are we
have a job for you. And we’ll probably teach you a few new ones while you’re
with us. Student and adult team members are encouraged to bring any skills they
already have, like programming, electronics, metalworking, graphic design, web
creation, public speaking, videography, and many more. FIRST Tech Challenge
welcomes *every student, with or without special skills*.

## What is a mentor? ##

day even if their team does not qualify for the elimination rounds.
