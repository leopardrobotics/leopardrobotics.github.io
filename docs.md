## Useful Links


- [FIRST](http://www.firstinspires.org): main FIRST website
  - [Official FTC Site](http://www.firstinspires.org/roboticsprograms/ftc)

  - [Mentor Manual](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/ftc-mentor-manual.pdf)
  - [Official FTC Forums](http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/forum.php): This is
    probably one of the most important links. The new game forums can be found
    here and will open up after kickoff. Keep up on the Relic Recovery forums as
    much as possible. Teams can post game questions here and they will get an
    official answer form FIRST. These answers then become rule. I have seen past
    games have things made illegal and posted on these forums. If you do not
    follow the forums or download updated game manuals you could go to a
    tournament and find out your robot is illegal. There are also some other
    subforums that get a lot of traffic once the season starts.
- [NEMO - Non-Engineering Mentor Organization](http://www.firstnemo.org/): a good resource for any non technical minded coaches/mentors
- [Official FTC blog](http://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/)

  - [Tournament Schedule](http://www.hightechkids.org/ftc-tournament-schedule): Tournament registration is $175 per event per team.

## Vendors
- [AndyMark](http://www.andymark.com/FTC-s/274.htm): One site that has FTC/FIRST components to purchase
- [Tetrix Robotics](https://www.tetrixrobotics.com/): another site for FTC components.  Tetrix is the main parts kit provided by FIRST when new teams register.
- [ServoCity](https://www.servocity.com/html/actobotics1.html): Similar to
  Tetrix, but their components seem to have more options for building. This
  company has giveaways quite often. They typically provide the giveaways for
  our October Rookie FTC Workshop
- [RevRobotics](http://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/): A more advanced building
  option using aluminum extrusions. The Iron Maidens moved to Rev last season
  and really like it.
