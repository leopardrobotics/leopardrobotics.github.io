Greetings, Students and Mentors!

It has been barely a week since the Mentors gathered in the Choir room of Lake
Middle School to discuss the future of our organization! The website is starting
to take shape as a hub for information. On the [Documentation](/docs) page,
you'll find references to the [information sheet][sheet] and [presentation slides][slides]
from our first general meeting on March 20, 2017.

This week, [sign-up sheets][sign-up] will be made available to students at school, but you
should watch this website. Once it is sent to the students, we'll post it here.
