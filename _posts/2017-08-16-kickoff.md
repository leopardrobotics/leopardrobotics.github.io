Save the date, *September 9th, 2017* for the FIRST Tech Challenge KICKOFF at the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Campus!

[High Tech Kids](http://www.hightechkids.org/ftc-kickoff-information) is hosting
the KICKOFF at no cost to participants. We are already registered for this
year's season, so we will get one of the game pieces per team just for
attending! After the game reveal, there will be a one hour lunch break.

[GOFIRST](https://mngofirst.org/), a University of Minnesota student group
comprised of FIRST alumni and robot enthusiasts, will be hosting
a [Post Kickoff ](https://mngofirst.org/events/post-kickoff) event for FTC teams
in Bruininks Hall for teams to begin analyzing and planning for the game!
