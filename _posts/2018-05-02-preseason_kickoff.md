*Pre-season Kickoff*

Mark your calendars for May 8th, Tuesday! We will be meeting for a
Pre-season Kickoff in the Media Room of Lake Middle School. For those
returning for the 2018-2019 season, this is the first time you will
get to meet your mentors, returning and new teammates!

Join us in the Media Room of Lake Middle School. We will have a
presentation starting at 7:00 followed by team breakouts. Team Mentors
will collect your Spring and Summer availability and set pre-season
goals.

While teams are in their break-outs, parents can receive help for
subscribing to Basecamp and FIRST team registrations.

*Woodbury Middle Robotics Club*

Woodbury Middle School *is* opening a club for robotics. We have
permission and student interest, but we are in grave need of mentors!
Look at some of the previous posts on this website if you're curious
about time requirements, etc. An informational meeting will be held on
*Wednesday, May 16, 2018* at 7:00 PM. Please spread the word!

*FIRST Lego League!*

We are happy to welcome FLL#32420 The Floating Chickens to Leopard
Robotics! FLL is great for incoming 6th graders or 7th and 8th graders
who were unable to get in to the FTC teams this year.  We'll be
reaching out to the area Elementary schools to announce FLL for
incoming 6th graders. Based on student interest level we may want to
start up an additional team or two, and if so, we would also need
parent coaches. Watch this site for more information.
