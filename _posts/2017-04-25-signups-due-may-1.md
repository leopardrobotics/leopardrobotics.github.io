We ran into some issues getting the robotics team set up at Lake. As a
consequence, the registration form didnâ€™t get released to the students until the
end of last week. Because of the delay, the registration forms will now be due
Monday, May 1st instead of April 24th. We will get back to interested students
with information on their team by May 12th, 2017.

You can access the sign-up sheets with this [link][sign-up]. Please print it
out, fill it in, and return it to Lake Middle School office, or email Jennifer
Sawyer.
