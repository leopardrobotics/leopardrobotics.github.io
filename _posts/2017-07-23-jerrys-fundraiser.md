Hello Lake Leopard Robotics teams,

In order to keep student fees as low as possible for students and families on
the Lake FTC Robotics team, we are pursuing corporate grants and fundraising
opportunities.

Our first fundraising opportunity is coming up on Sunday, August 20th at Jerry’s
Foods in
Woodbury -
[7760 Hargis Parkway](https://goo.gl/maps/oxLsgPqifJy "Google Maps to 7760 Hargis Parkway"),
near the roundabout at Bailey and Radio.

There are two shifts:

 - 8:45 - 12:00 (training from 8:45 - 9:00, and grocery bagging from 9:00 - 12:00)

 - 11:45 - 3:00 (training from 11:45 - 12:00, and grocery bagging from 12:00 - 3:00)

*Students need to wear closed toe shoes.*

If we have team t-shirts in time, please wear those as well. We will have poster
displays explaining what FTC robotics is.

PLEASE consider signing up and volunteering so we can keep fees as low as
possible. If we have a lot of students sign up, we can split the shifts in half
so each student works for 90 minutes.

I am looking for a few mentors for each shift. There’s no maximum number, so if
the slots show as full, and you want to come, please do!
