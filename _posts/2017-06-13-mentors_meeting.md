Tonight we will be having a Mentors' General Meeting at 7:30 PM in the Choir
Room at Lake Middle School. Times are relative, and I'd like to end general
business a little early. Please bring ideas on fund raising and sponsorships!

Agenda:

- 7:30  Introductions and Minutes Review (anyone take minutes for the last Mentor's meeting?)
- 7:35  Treasurer Report (What we have, and what we've purchased)
- 7:40  Near-term Budget Planning
- 7:50  Sponsorship, Fundraising, Etc. (Bring ideas!)
- 8:05  Plan Topics for First Team Meetings
- 8:15  Schedule Next Mentor's Meeting
- 8:20  How did we do? (Rate 1-5)

For an after-session, lead mentors, please bring your laptops. We will go over
how to order the team registrations and two robot kit of parts.

8:30 Technical Support/Setting up FIRST Teams, Purchase Orders, etc.
