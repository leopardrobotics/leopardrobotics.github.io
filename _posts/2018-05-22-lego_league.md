of your earthly constraints and go INTO ORBIT. The 2018/2019 FIRST
LEGO League season will transport your team into space, where you’ll
explore, challenge, and innovate in the vast expanse of space. FIRST
LEGO League challenges kids to think like scientists and engineers,
solving real-world problems, and building an autonomous robot to solve
a set of missions in the Robot Game. Throughout their experience,
teams will celebrate discovery, teamwork, and Gracious
Professionalism.
