On Tuesday the 25th of July, we will be having a Mentors' General Meeting
at 7:30 PM in the Choir Room at Lake Middle School. Times are relative, and I'd
like to end general business a little early. Please bring ideas on fund raising
and sponsorships!

Agenda:

- 7:30  Introductions and Treasurer Report
- 7:35  Minutes Review and Follow-up Discussion
- 7:45  New Business
  - Lead Mentor's Reports
  - Jerry's Fundraiser on Sunday, August 20th
  - KICK-OFF on Saturday, Steptember 9th
  - Big FRC Event at East Ridge on Saturday, Steptember 16th
  - Etc.
- 8:25  How did we do? (Rate 1-5)
