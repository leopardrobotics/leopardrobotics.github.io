{{ site.title }} will be having two to three [FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg;
League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll "FLL Information
Page") teams for the 2018-2019 season, which runs from August through
December. This robotics program is designed to get children excited
about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).  Teams
design, build and program an autonomous robot (using the LEGO&reg;
MINDSTORMS&reg; robot set) to score points on a 4x8 foot playing
surface.  This year’s challenge also encompasses a student research
project around the theme “Into Orbit”.


See this
[infographic](http://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/stem-bundle/FLL_Start_a_Team_Infographic.pdf
"FLL Infographic") for a quick overview.

# Who

Open to all 6th-8th grade students.  We will have multiple teams if we
get enough coaches, and there will be 5-8 students on each team.  Each
team will need to have two coaches, and the coaches do _not_ need to
know programming.

Area students who do not attend Lake Middle School yet do not
currently have a similarly offered activity at their school may apply
for this program.

# When

Team meeting day/time/frequency will be dependent on coach
arrangement.  Student must be available for the competition.

# Where

We will meet at Lake Middle School or other location as determined by coach.

# Cost

$90 registration fee.  Covers the cost of registering the teams with
First Lego League and High Tech Kids as well as the set up kit.

# Sign-up!
