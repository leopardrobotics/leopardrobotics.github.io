calendar is publicly accessible here. Expect to find club-level events and
mentor meeting announcements here.

Within Basecamp, there are separate calendars for Team and Mentors. If you are a
Team member of Mentor, you will be assigned appropriately and will have access
to these calendars, which you can link or import into your favorite calendaring
application. For more information on using these calendars in Basecamp, visit
[Basecamp Support](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/49-schedule "Basecamp
Support for Schedules").
